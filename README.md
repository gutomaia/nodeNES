A c6502 compiler for Nintendo 8 bits written in javascript.

## Goal

NodeNES aims to be a full NES IDE in the browser. It contains a c6502 compiler compatible with NESASM and a sprite editor. It was built using TDD as a philosophy and not just a way of coding.

## Test Driven Development

Tests are great and really guide this project. Every step was followed by a test. The compiler has grown around tests. Therefore its compability has increased anddemos and examples are provided as fixtures. You can even track the learning proccess by watching the commit log over the history of the project. You will find several ways to steal on tests before the end of the race.

## Running

Just use the `run` task:

```
make run
```

## How to contribute

I will try to put a list of current issues on Github Issues. If you don't know where to start, ask me. I will find something for you that is easy to start.
